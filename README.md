# RonnieJS

RonnieJS is a tiny JavaScript Loader that loads your scripts in the right order based on the dependencies declared inside an external configuration file.

**Note:** RonnieJS is still under development. Feel free to take a look at the code
in this branch, but you really shouldn't use it in your projects.
